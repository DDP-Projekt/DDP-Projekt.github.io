# VS Code support
With the official [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DDP-Projekt.vscode-ddp), you can easily write DDP without even knowing how to spell!

There is also sematic highlighting, so you can actually read your code and much more.

Using the [language server](https://github.com/DDP-Projekt/DDPLS) it's possible to write extension for other editors
